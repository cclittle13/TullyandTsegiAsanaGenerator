===========
As‚ù§naGenerator gives users a tool to create a yoga sequence, with an extensive and original database of asanas to create a beginning, intermediate or advanced practice. Intended for yoga teachers looking for specialization and variety in their classes, it is also useful for all yoginis and yogis within their home practice/self-study. This app queries the database to search for selected asanas and builds a personalized sequence based on user input; with specific features that allow for randomization, Sanskrit translation quizzing, pose detail, pregnancy contraindication searching, and receiving a "Pose-of-the-Day" text message using the Twilio API. Once registered and logged in, users can also save their generated sequences for future use.
